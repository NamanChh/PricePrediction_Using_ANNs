## ABSTRACT

This Price Predction model can be used the predict the total amount (in dollars) which a customer is willing to pay. This model uses concepts of Deep Learning such as Artificial Neural Networks to perform the given task. Regression in ANNs involves learning the mapping between input variables and continuous output values through a process of iterative parameter optimization such as backpropagation.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises of 500 data points stored as rows, each containing 9 features in columns.

Given the following attributes: 
- Customer Name
- Customer e-mail
- Country
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Salary 
- Credit Card Debt 
- Net Worth 

The model should predict: 
- Car Purchase Amount 


## Conclusion
In conclusion, we can say that ANNs offer advantages over linear regression due to their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships, automatically learn relevant features, handle noise, capture interactions, scale to large datasets, and generalize well. While linear regression is simple and interpretable, ANNs excel in scenarios requiring sophisticated modeling, making them suitable for diverse real-world applications.
